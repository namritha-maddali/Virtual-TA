It’s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\nHere’s how it works:\nIt takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n… using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with\n=\nto make the length a multiple of 4)\nThere’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs\nBase64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\nimport\nbase64\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext\n=\n\"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded\n=\nbase64\n.\nb64encode\n(\ntext\n.\nencode\n(\n)\n)\n.\ndecode\n(\n)\n# SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded\n=\nbase64\n.\nb64decode\n(\nencoded\n)\n.\ndecode\n(\n)\n# Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe\n=\nbase64\n.\nurlsafe_b64encode\n(\ntext\n.\nencode\n(\n)\n)\n.\ndecode\n(\n)\n# SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith\nopen\n(\n'image.png'\n,\n'rb'\n)\nas\nf\n:\nbinary_data\n=\nf\n.\nread\n(\n)\nimage_b64\n=\nbase64\n.\nb64encode\n(\nbinary_data\n)\n.\ndecode\n(\n)\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri\n=\nf\"data:image/png;base64,\n{\nimage_b64\n}\n\"\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\nFor example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n<\nimg\nsrc\n=\n\"\ndata:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\n\"\n/>\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nBase64 is used in many places:\nJSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\nEmail: MIME attachments encoding\nAuth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\nJWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\nSSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\nSAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\nGit: Encoding binary files in patches\nTools for working with Base64:\nBase64 Decoder/Encoder\nfor online encoding/decoding\ndata: URI Generator\nconverts files to Data URIs"

This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\nUse Cases:\nLLM training and fine-tuning\n: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\nKnowledge base creation\n: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\nContent repurposing\n: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\nData extraction\n: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\nAccessibility\n: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\nCitation and reference management\n: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\nDocumentation conversion\n: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\nPyMuPDF4LLM\nPyMuPDF4LLM\nis a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses\nMuPDF\nas its PDF parsing engine.\nPyMuPDF\nis emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\nPYTHONUTF8\n=\n1\nuv run\n--with\npymupdf4llm python\n-c\n'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nPYTHONUTF8=1\n: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\nuv run --with pymupdf4llm\n: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\npython -c '...'\n: Executes Python code directly from the command line\nimport pymupdf4llm\n: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\nh = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")\n: Creates a file to write the markdown output\nh.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))\n: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\nMarkitdown\nMarkitdown\nis Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\nPYTHONUTF8\n=\n1\nuvx markitdown\n$FILE\n.pdf\n>\nmarkitdown.md\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nPYTHONUTF8=1\n: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\nuvx markitdown\n: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n$FILE.pdf\n: The input PDF file\n> markitdown.md\n: Redirects output to a markdown file\nUnstructured\nUnstructured\nis rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\nGROBID\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones,\nGROBID\nremains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.\n# Start GROBID service\ndocker\nrun\n-t\n--rm\n-p\n8070\n:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2\n# Process PDF with curl\ncurl\n-X\nPOST\n-F\n\"input=@paper.pdf\"\nlocalhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument\n>\nreferences.tei.xml\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nMistral OCR API\nMistral OCR\noffers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\nAzure Document Intelligence API\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem,\nAzure Document Intelligence\nprovides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities.\nOther libraries\nDocling\nis IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.\nMegaParse\ntakes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.\nComparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools\nTool\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nBest For\nPyMuPDF4LLM\nStructure preservation, LLM optimization\nRequires PyTorch\nAI training data, semantic structure\nMarkitdown\nMulti-format support, simple usage\nLess precise layout handling\nBatch processing, mixed documents\nUnstructured\nWide format support, active development\nCan be resource-intensive\nProduction pipelines, integration\nGROBID\nReference extraction excellence\nNarrower use case\nAcademic papers, citations\nDocling\nAdvanced document understanding\nInstallation difficulties\nResearch applications\nMegaParse\nComprehensive approach\nRequires OpenAI API\nComplex documents, OCR needs\nHow to pick:\nNeed LLM-ready content?\nPyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this\nWorking with multiple document formats?\nMarkitdown handles diverse inputs\nExtracting academic references?\nGROBID remains the standard\nBuilding a production pipeline?\nUnstructured offers the best integration options\nHandling complex layouts?\nConsider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence\nThe optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.\nTips for Optimal PDF Conversion\nPre-process PDFs\nwhen possible:\n# Optimize a PDF for text extraction first\nocrmypdf\n--optimize\n3\n--skip-text input.pdf optimized.pdf\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nTry multiple tools\non the same document to compare results:\nHandle scanned PDFs\nappropriately:\n# For scanned documents, run OCR first\nocrmypdf --force-ocr input.pdf ocr_ready.pdf\nPYTHONUTF8\n=\n1\nuvx markitdown ocr_ready.pdf\n>\nmarkitdown.md\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nConsider post-processing\nfor better results:\n# Simple post-processing example\nsed\n-i\n's/\\([A-Z]\\)\\./\\1\\.\\n/g'\noutput.md\n# Add line breaks after sentences\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied"

If FORMAT is FORMAT1\n<\nnewline\n>\nFORMAT2,\nthen FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.\nTIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.\nAlso the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.\n\nUsing color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and\nwith --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when\nstandard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment\nvariable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.\n\nExit status:\n 0  if OK,\n 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),\n 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).\n\nGNU coreutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>\nFull documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls>\nor available locally via: info '(coreutils) ls invocation'\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n# By default, it just lists all file names\n!ls\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nsample_data  s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n# If we want to see the size of the file, use `-l` for the long-listing format\n!ls\n-\nl\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\ntotal 5672\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5801198 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nUncompress the log file\ngzip\nis the most popular compression format on the web.

Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data.\nThe second way is you can\nquery it\nfrom somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\nThe third way is you have to\nscrape it\n. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\nHere are links used in the video:\nThe Movies Dataset\nIMDb Datasets\nDownload the IMDb Datasets\nExplore the Internet Movie Database\nWhat does the world search for?\nHowStat - Cricket statistics\nCricket Strike Rates"

These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\nSearch\n. Find similar documents to a query.\nClassification\n. Classify text into categories.\nClustering\n. Group similar items into clusters.\nAnomaly Detection\n. Find an unusual piece of text.\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\nFeature\nLocal Models\nAPI\nPrivacy\nHigh\nDependent on provider\nCost\nHigh setup, low after that\nPay-as-you-go\nScale\nLimited by local resources\nEasily scales with demand\nQuality\nVaries by model\nTypically high\nThe\nMassive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)\nprovides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\nRank\n. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\nMemory Usage\n. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\nEmbedding Dimensions\n. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\nMax Tokens\n. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a\nsingle\ninput.\nLook for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\nLocal Embeddings\nHere’s a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"numpy\",\n# ]\n# ///\nfrom\nsentence_transformers\nimport\nSentenceTransformer\nimport\nnumpy\nas\nnp\n\nmodel\n=\nSentenceTransformer\n(\n'BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5'\n)\n# A small, high quality model\nasync\ndef\nembed\n(\ntext\n:\nstr\n)\n-\n>\nlist\n[\nfloat\n]\n:\n\"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"\nreturn\nmodel\n.\nencode\n(\ntext\n)\n.\ntolist\n(\n)\nasync\ndef\nget_similarity\n(\ntext1\n:\nstr\n,\ntext2\n:\nstr\n)\n-\n>\nfloat\n:\n\"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"\nemb1\n=\nnp\n.\narray\n(\nawait\nembed\n(\ntext1\n)\n)\nemb2\n=\nnp\n.\narray\n(\nawait\nembed\n(\ntext2\n)\n)\nreturn\nfloat\n(\nnp\n.\ndot\n(\nemb1\n,\nemb2\n)\n/\n(\nnp\n.\nlinalg\n.\nnorm\n(\nemb1\n)\n*\nnp\n.\nlinalg\n.\nnorm\n(\nemb2\n)\n)\n)\nasync\ndef\nmain\n(\n)\n:\nprint\n(\nawait\nget_similarity\n(\n\"Apple\"\n,\n\"Orange\"\n)\n)\nprint\n(\nawait\nget_similarity\n(\n\"Apple\"\n,\n\"Lightning\"\n)\n)\nif\n__name__\n==\n\"__main__\"\n:\nimport\nasyncio\n    asyncio\n.\nrun\n(\nmain\n(\n)\n)\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nNote the\nget_similarity\nfunction. It uses a\nCosine Similarity\nto calculate the similarity between two embeddings.\nOpenAI Embeddings\nFor comparison, here’s how to use OpenAI’s API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the\nembed\nfunction in the earlier script:\nimport\nos\nimport\nhttpx\nasync\ndef\nembed\n(\ntext\n:\nstr\n)\n-\n>\nlist\n[\nfloat\n]\n:\n\"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\"\nasync\nwith\nhttpx\n.\nAsyncClient\n(\n)\nas\nclient\n:\nresponse\n=\nawait\nclient\n.\npost\n(\n\"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\"\n,\nheaders\n=\n{\n\"Authorization\"\n:\nf\"Bearer\n{\nos\n.\nenviron\n[\n'OPENAI_API_KEY'\n]\n}\n\"\n}\n,\njson\n=\n{\n\"model\"\n:\n\"text-embedding-3-small\"\n,\n\"input\"\n:\ntext\n}\n)\nreturn\nresponse\n.\njson\n(\n)\n[\n\"data\"\n]\n[\n0\n]\n[\n\"embedding\"\n]\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nNOTE\n: You need to set the\nOPENAI_API_KEY\nenvironment variable for this to work."

Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.\nThey can handle audio input.\nThis allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\nLLMs are not good at transcribing audio\nfaithfully\n. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:\nTranscribe into other languages\n. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step.\nSummarize audio transcripts\n. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions.\nLegal Proceeding Analysis\n. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate.\nMedical Consultation Summary\n. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation.\nHere’s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\nGet a\nGemini API key\nfrom Google AI Studio.\nSet the\nGEMINI_API_KEY\nenvironment variable to the API key.\nSet the\nMP3_FILE\nenvironment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe.\nRun this code:\ncurl\n-X\nPOST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt\n=\nsse\n\\\n-H\n\"X-Goog-API-Key:\n$GEMINI_API_KEY\n\"\n\\\n-H\n\"Content-Type: application/json\"\n\\\n-d\n\"$(cat << EOF\n{\n  \"contents\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"parts\": [\n        {\n          \"inline_data\": {\n            \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\",\n            \"data\": \"\n$(\nbase64\n--wrap\n=\n0\n$MP3_FILE\n)\n\"\n}\n}\n,\n{\n\"text\"\n:\n\"Transcribe this\"\n}\n]\n}\n]\n}\nEOF\n)\n\"\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied"

Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.\nHere are things you should know when you’re compressing images:\nImage dimensions\nare the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot\nLossless\ncompression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data\nLossy\ncompression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files\nVector\nformats (SVG) scale without quality loss\nWebP\nis the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless\nHere’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.\nUse SVG if you can (i.e. if it’s vector graphics or you can convert it to one)\nElse, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP\nCommon operations with Python:\nfrom\npathlib\nimport\nPath\nfrom\nPIL\nimport\nImage\nimport\nio\nasync\ndef\ncompress_image\n(\ninput_path\n:\nPath\n,\noutput_path\n:\nPath\n,\nquality\n:\nint\n=\n85\n)\n-\n>\nNone\n:\n\"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\"\nwith\nImage\n.\nopen\n(\ninput_path\n)\nas\nimg\n:\n# Convert RGBA to RGB if needed\nif\nimg\n.\nmode\n==\n'RGBA'\n:\nimg\n=\nimg\n.\nconvert\n(\n'RGB'\n)\n# Optimize for web\nimg\n.\nsave\n(\noutput_path\n,\n'WEBP'\n,\nquality\n=\nquality\n,\noptimize\n=\nTrue\n)\n# Batch process images\npaths\n=\nPath\n(\n'images'\n)\n.\nglob\n(\n'*.jpg'\n)\nfor\np\nin\npaths\n:\nawait\ncompress_image\n(\np\n,\np\n.\nwith_suffix\n(\n'.webp'\n)\n)\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nCommand line tools include\ncwebp\n,\npngquant\n,\njpegoptim\n, and\nImageMagick\n.\n# Convert to WebP\ncwebp\n-q\n85\ninput.png\n-o\noutput.webp\n# Optimize PNG\npngquant\n--quality\n=\n65\n-80 image.png\n# Optimize JPEG\njpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive\n--max\n=\n85\nimage.jpg\n# Convert and resize\nconvert input.jpg\n-resize\n800x600 output.jpg\n# Batch convert\nmogrify\n-format\nwebp\n-quality\n85\n*.jpg\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nWatch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min):\nTools for image optimization:\nsquoosh.app\n: Browser-based compression\nImageOptim\n: GUI tool for Mac\nsharp\n: Node.js image processing\nPillow\n: Python imaging library"

You should be able to see them on YouTube.\nQ2: How should I approach TDS?\nA2:\nThe best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools.\nQ3: I’m new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?\nA3:\nGA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules.\nQ4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?\nA4:\nThe TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded.\nQ5: I’m not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?\nA5:\nThe course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs’ sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap.\nQ6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven’t gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?\nA6:\nThe course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up.\nQ7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?\nA7:\nThe TAs will hold sessions\nbefore\nthe GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools.\nQ8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?\nA8:\nThe end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools.\nQ9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?\nA9:\nYour answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this.\nQ10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?\nA10:\nThe projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You’ll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions.\nQ11: I’m a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?\nA11:\nIt’s possible, but it depends on the company’s requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields.\nQ12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?\nA12:\nProgramming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other.\nQ13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?\nA13:\nBash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand.\nQ14: What if I want to learn the tools more deeply?\nA14:\nLearn by using the tools frequently in your workflows. The instructors will provide more support sessions.\nQ15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?\nA15:\nThe instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment.\nQ16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?\nA16:\nYes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar. Bookmark the TDS channel to easily find the playlist. The videos themselves will be on YouTube.\nQ17: Can you request the programming faculty to add content similar to TDS to the programming diploma?\nA17:\nPost this request on Discourse and tag the relevant people.\nQ18: What is a “take-home open internet” project?\nA18:\nYou’ll receive a dataset and questions. You can use any resources to answer the questions.\nQ19: What weeks are relevant to each project?\nA19:\nProject 1 will cover the first four or five modules. Project 2 will cover a wider range of topics.\nQ20: I have a basic understanding of the tools, but not a great one. Should I continue or drop the course?\nA20:\nIf you can solve the problems, that’s good enough. The course is meant to introduce you to the tools, not make you an expert. Focus on the new tools and techniques. You can always get certifications for other skills later."

The focus is on guiding students toward solutions, not providing exact answers. Week 2 will be covered in the next session.\nQ2: Is it possible to reschedule the TDS session?\nA2:\nThe instructor will check if rescheduling is possible. If not, recordings will be available on YouTube.\nQ3: The first question in the graded assignment is about VS Code. What’s involved?\nA3:\nThe question focuses on installing VS Code and running a specific command in the terminal, then pasting the output into an input box. There’s no significant technical component to this question.\nQ4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?\nA4:\nUV eliminates the need to create virtual environments. You include small portions of code and run the application with minimal setup.\nQ5: How does UV integrate with VS Code?\nA5:\nThere’s no integration; UV is used in the command prompt, similar to pip (Python), npm (JavaScript), or Node.js.\nQ6: Are there examples demonstrating UV usage and integration with VS Code?\nA6:\nNo specific VS Code integration is needed. UV is used in the command line, like pip or npm. A previous project (Project 2) used UV to automate running 687 student Python submissions, each with unique requirements. Students added metadata to their Python files specifying the Python version and required libraries. UV dynamically handled these requirements for each submission.\nQ7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?\nA7:\nThe format will be similar to the graded assignments: questions and answer boxes. You can use any tools you want. It’s a non-proctored exam. It will cover concepts taught in the course, including new material.\nQ8: In Week 1, do we need to build advanced-level concepts, or will we learn them week by week?\nA8:\nEach week will have different content, including graded assignments. Content links are provided.\nQ9: The UV part of the project was only a 7-minute video. Do we need to learn UV fully in Week 1, or will we learn it in upcoming weeks?\nA9:\nUV is introduced in Week 1. The most useful aspect is embedding everything in inline metadata within the script, eliminating the need for virtual environments.\nQ10: How do we start the project?\nA10:\nThere will be separate guidance sessions for the project.\nQ11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?\nA11:\nYes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube.\nQ12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?\nA12:\nIt works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute).\nQ13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?\nA13:\nRight-click on the browser and select “Inspect.” This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser.\nQ14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?\nA14:\nThe Console tab lets you run JavaScript. This will be covered later in the session, in the context of CSS selectors.\nQ15: Can you explain the Network tab in DevTools?\nA15:\nThe Network tab shows all external information the browser is fetching. For TDS, the “Fetch” tab is most useful, showing APIs, JSON code, and CSS files. It shows what the website is pulling from the server.\nQ16: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?\nA16:\nNo, you can only modify the website’s structure in the Elements tab.\nQ17: Can you explain the Network tab again, briefly?\nA17:\nThe Network tab shows external information the browser is fetching from where the website is deployed. The “Fetch” tab is particularly useful for TDS, showing APIs, JSON, and CSS files.\nQ18: In a later Week 1 question, we need to find values within a specific div class. Will the JavaScript code work on the entire site, or just the specified area?\nA18:\nThe JavaScript will work on the entire site because the DOM structure is a tree. However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure.\nQ19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information?\nA19:\nHTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs).\nQ20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?\nA20:\nThe code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements.\ninnerText\ngives the text content of an element, while\ninnerHTML\ngives the entire HTML code.\ninnerText\nis generally preferred for data extraction.\nQ21: Are there other commands or attributes besides\ninnerText\n?\nA21:\nYes, there are other attributes.\ntext\nis similar to\ninnerText\n, but\ninnerText\nis more reliable. Always use\ninnerText\nif\ntext\ndoesn’t work.\nQ22: How do classes and IDs work in CSS selectors?\nA22:\nClasses are generic and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs are unique to a single element. In CSS selectors, classes are prefixed with a dot (.), and IDs with a hash (#).\nQ23: While showing\ninnerText\n, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?\nA23:\nThe console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array.\nQ24: How can I copy the entire list from the console?\nA24:\nEnclose the code in a\ncopy()\nfunction. This copies the output to your clipboard.\nQ25: Does the developer tool only work on Chrome?\nA25:\nIt works on Edge and other browsers. In Safari or Mozilla, right-click anywhere on the webpage and look for the “Inspect” option.\nQ26: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?\nA26:\nNo, you can only modify the website’s structure in the Elements tab. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching, not what you can change.\nQ27: Can you explain the use of classes in more detail?\nA27:\nClasses allow you to apply CSS to your code. If you remove a class, the associated CSS styling is removed. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, while IDs are unique to a single element.\nQ28: Can we limit JavaScript selection to a specific chunk of HTML data?\nA28:\nNo, JavaScript will work on the entire site unless you use selectors to target specific elements.\nQ29: What is the origin of the exercise to extract names from the meeting participants?\nA29:\nThe instructor created this exercise to encourage participation. A random participant is selected to answer a question.\nQ30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?\nA30:\nThe syntax was\n$$(\".className\").map(...)\n. The\n$$\nselects elements with the specified class, and\nmap\niterates through them. The instructor demonstrates how to extract the movie names using this. The instructor also explains the difference between\ninnerText\nand\ninnerHTML\n.\ninnerText\nreturns only the text, while\ninnerHTML\nreturns the entire HTML code.\ninnerText\nis generally preferred for data extraction. If\ntext\ndoesn’t work, use\ninnerText\n.\nQ31: Should the\ninnerText\nbe written exactly as it appears, or can we modify the case (e.g., make “T” lowercase)?\nA31:\nUse the text exactly as it appears.\nQ32: What is the role of npx in this context?\nA32:\nnpx creates a separate environment for a project, installing dependencies locally without affecting other projects. It’s an alternative to npm, which installs globally.\nQ33: Does npx run primarily on Linux?\nA33:\nnpx works on both PowerShell and Bash, but sha256sum might not work on Windows. You can run the npx command separately and use sha256sum on the resulting file.\nQ34: While showing\ninnerText\n, you made the movie list extremely neat. Why?\nA34:\nThat’s how the console presents the data, organizing it into groups of 100 for readability.\nQ35: How can I copy the entire list from the console?\nA35:\nUse the\ncopy()\nfunction in the console to copy the output to your clipboard.\nQ36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?\nA36:\nFor the Elements tab, focus on extracting data using CSS selectors (classes and IDs). The Console tab is used for running JavaScript, particularly for data scraping with CSS selectors. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching. The instructor recommends exploring these tabs and having fun with them."

Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there’s one Wednesday per week, that’s the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn’t a Wednesday, a different approach is needed.\nQ2: How to handle dates that don’t start on a Wednesday?\nA2:\nInstead of starting from the given date, start from the next day (e.g., if it starts on Tuesday, start on Wednesday). Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient.\nQ3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file?\nA3:\nThis is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The instructor skips this question.\nQ4: What is JSON and how is it used?\nA4:\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to store data, like names and ages of students or employees. It uses key-value pairs. The instructor demonstrates creating a JSON object in Python, showing how to access elements using indexing and nested structures. JSON can also be used in JavaScript and browser consoles.\nQ5: How can I access data from a JSON object?\nA5:\nThe instructor shows how to access elements within a JSON object using indexing in Python. For example, to access the name of the third student in a list, you would use\nstudents[2][name]\n. JSON allows hierarchical data storage, making it easy to retrieve specific values.\nQ6: How does JSON get loaded on a website (e.g., Discourse)?\nA6:\nWebsites often fetch JSON data from backend servers. The instructor shows an example on the Discourse website, where different data (weekly, yearly) is loaded based on the request parameters in the URL. Multiple filters can be added to the URL to refine the data fetched.\nQ7: How can I use Python to access JSON data from a URL?\nA7:\nThe instructor demonstrates using the\nrequests\nlibrary in Python to fetch JSON data from a URL. The response status code (e.g., 200 for success) indicates whether the request was successful. The JSON data is then accessible as a Python dictionary. The instructor uses Postman to show how to send API requests and view the JSON response.\nQ8: What is Postman and how does it work?\nA8:\nPostman is a tool that acts as an intermediary between you and an API. It sends API calls and retrieves the data. Alternatively, the Thunder Client extension in VS Code can be used for the same purpose.\nQ9: What are CSS selectors and combinators?\nA9:\nThe instructor explains CSS selectors and combinators, focusing on basic selectors and the direct child combinator (\n>\n) which selects only direct children of an element. More advanced combinators are mentioned but not covered in detail.\nQ10: How to handle large JSON objects or datasets?\nA10:\nFor large datasets, copying and pasting is impractical. Instead, use Python and API calls to fetch and process the data programmatically. This avoids overwhelming the browser and allows for automation.\nQ11: How to handle encoding issues when opening CSV files?\nA11:\nWhen opening CSV files, especially those with unusual characters, specify the correct encoding (e.g., using the\nencoding\nparameter in pandas). The instructor shows how to detect the encoding of a file using Python and then uses pandas to open the file with the detected encoding.\nQ12: How to use Git and GitHub?\nA12:\nThe instructor suggests covering Git and GitHub in a separate session due to the complexity and time required for a thorough explanation.\nQ13: How to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in VS Code?\nA13:\nThe instructor explains how to use the WSL extension in VS Code to access a Linux terminal within VS Code. This is useful for running bash commands. The instructor notes that the default terminal in a Mac might not support all commands, so WSL is an alternative.\nQ14: Why does the course feel overwhelming?\nA14:\nThe instructor acknowledges that the course challenges students’ logical thinking by introducing concepts and tools not previously taught. The instructor encourages students to use ChatGPT to help bridge knowledge gaps and emphasizes that the course aims to build a strong foundation and encourage exploration beyond the curriculum. The instructor also points out that the course materials are available in the course portal, including content for weeks beyond the current one. A feedback form is provided for students to report challenges and suggest improvements."

The “fitting of six models” project was a simplified version done for a friend’s certification course. It involved training six models on a pre-cleaned dataset with some hyperparameter tuning but minimal data preprocessing or cleaning.\nQ2: Is the TDS project designed to provide a level playing field for everyone, considering some participants may lack coding experience?\nA2:\nThe TDS project aims to combine everything learned in the course so far. It might seem challenging, especially for those without a coding background. The project requires creating an application with specific endpoints, pushing it to GitHub, creating a Docker file, and submitting it through a Google form. However, the course is designed to bridge the technical gap for non-technical participants, preparing them for industry standards. The instructors will provide support through dedicated sessions, and students are encouraged to use resources like ChatGPT and YouTube videos.\nQ3: What are the main components of the TDS project, and what tools are involved?\nA3:\nThe TDS project has three main parts:\nGitHub:\nFor version control and code storage.\nDocker Hub:\nFor containerizing and deploying the application.\nLLM (Large Language Model):\nFor the core functionality of the application.\nThe project involves using Fast API or similar frameworks to create the application, Podman to run the Docker image, and a form to submit the GitHub and Docker file details.\nQ4: How does the project accommodate participants from non-science or non-coding backgrounds?\nA4:\nThe course aims to equip all participants, regardless of their background, with the necessary skills for the industry. It provides support through live sessions, encourages the use of external resources like ChatGPT and YouTube, and offers dedicated project sessions. The goal is to bridge the technical gap and prepare everyone for real-world challenges.\nQ5: How can I seek help or clarification on the project, especially if I find it overwhelming?\nA5:\nYou can ask questions during the live sessions, utilize the course forum, or reach out to the instructors directly through the designated channels. Additionally, you can use resources like ChatGPT for assistance.\nQ6: What are the key tools and technologies used in the TDS project?\nA6:\nKey tools include Git for version control, GitHub for code hosting, Docker for containerization, Podman for running Docker images, and Fast API (or similar frameworks) for creating the application.\nQ7: How can I use VS Code for managing my Git repository?\nA7:\nVS Code has extensions that simplify Git operations. You can initialize a new Git instance, connect it to a remote GitHub repository, commit changes with messages, and manage branches all within the VS Code interface.\nQ8: How can I handle case-insensitive replacements in files using command-line tools?\nA8:\nYou can use the\nsed\neditor with the\n-i\noption for in-place editing and the\nI\nflag for case-insensitive matching. You can combine this with\nfind\nto locate and modify multiple files within a directory structure.\nQ9: How do I set up the connection between my local Git instance and a remote GitHub repository?\nA9:\nYou can use the\ngit remote add origin <repository URL>\ncommand to establish the connection. You can find the specific URL on the GitHub repository page.\nQ10: What if I encounter issues while trying to push changes to GitHub?\nA10:\nIf you’re using HTTPS, you’ll need to use a personal access token instead of your password for authentication. If you encounter errors, ensure you have configured your Git username and email correctly using\ngit config\n. You might also need to check the permissions granted to your personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication.\nQ11: How many students are regularly attending the live sessions?\nA11:\nThe attendance in the live sessions is lower than expected, with around 15-25 students at peak times, compared to the 400-500 enrolled in the current term.\nQ12: What is the new feature added for TDS live sessions?\nA12:\nA new feature has been added that curates the live sessions into a few important portions, providing a summary of the questions asked and their answers. This allows students who missed a session to quickly catch up on the key topics discussed.\nQ13: When is the next session scheduled, and will it clash with college classes?\nA13:\nThe next session is scheduled for 5 PM. There might be clashes with college classes, as the schedule is pre-planned with classes on Tuesdays from 5-7 PM, Wednesdays from 9-10 AM, and other classes from 8-10 PM.\nQ14: Where can I find the link for the new feature summarizing live sessions?\nA14:\nThe link has been emailed to all participants and can also be found at the very bottom of the course page.\nQ15: How can I get support regarding any particular topic in the project?\nA15:\nYou can use the “Learning Feedback” form on the portal to submit your queries related to specific modules or topics. The responses are used to plan future sessions.\nQ16: What is GitHub, and how is it used in the project?\nA16:\nGitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories. It allows for version control, collaboration, and code sharing. In the project, you will push your code to a GitHub repository, making it accessible to others and enabling collaboration.\nQ17: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?\nA17:\nGit is a version control system that you install and use on your local machine, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing for remote collaboration and code sharing.\nQ18: What are the alternatives to using command-line tools for Git and GitHub operations?\nA18:\nYou can use a graphical interface like VS Code with Git extensions to manage your Git repositories and interact with GitHub. This can be more user-friendly than using command-line tools.\nQ19: How does the\nsed\neditor work for replacing text in files?\nA19:\nThe\nsed\neditor is a stream editor that can perform text transformations on input streams. You can use it with the\ns\ncommand for substitution, specifying the pattern to match and the replacement text. The\ng\nflag indicates global replacement (all occurrences), and the\nI\nflag enables case-insensitive matching.\nQ1: How can I use the\nfind\ncommand to locate files for processing with\nsed\n?\nA21:\nThe\nfind\ncommand can locate files based on various criteria, such as name, type, and location. You can use the\n-exec\noption to execute a command, like\nsed\n, on each file found. For example,\nfind . -type f -exec sed -i 's/IITM/IIT Madras/gI' {} \\;\nwill find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories and replace “IITM” with “IIT Madras” (case-insensitive) in each file.\nQ22: Why am I getting an “authentication failed” error when pushing to GitHub?\nA22:\nThis could be because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. You need to use a personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication.\nQ23: How do I create and use a personal access token for GitHub authentication?\nA23:\nYou can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings under “Developer settings.” When pushing to GitHub, use your GitHub username and the generated token instead of your password.\nQ24: How do I set up SSH keys for GitHub authentication?\nA24:\nYou can generate SSH keys using the\nssh-keygen\ncommand and then add the public key to your GitHub account settings. This allows you to authenticate without using a password or personal access token.\nQ25: What is the purpose of the\ngit remote add origin\ncommand?\nA25:\nThis command adds a remote repository named “origin” to your local Git instance. “Origin” is a conventional name for the primary remote repository, and the URL specifies the location of the remote repository on GitHub.\nQ26: How can I update the remote URL if I have already added one?\nA26:\nYou can update the remote URL using the\ngit remote set-url origin <new URL>\ncommand, replacing\n<new URL>\nwith the correct URL of your GitHub repository.\nQ27: What is the difference between committing and pushing in Git?\nA27:\nCommitting saves changes to your local Git instance, while pushing uploads those committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.\nQ28: How can I use VS Code to simplify Git operations?\nA28:\nVS Code has built-in Git integration and extensions that provide a graphical interface for managing your repository. You can stage changes, commit them with messages, push to remote repositories, manage branches, and perform other Git operations without using the command line.\nQ29: What is the significance of the\n.git\nfolder in my project directory?\nA29:\nThe\n.git\nfolder is a hidden directory that contains all the information related to your Git instance, including the history of commits, branches, and other metadata. It’s essential for version control and should not be modified directly.\nQ30: How can I ensure that my code is backed up and accessible to collaborators?\nA30:\nBy pushing your code to a remote GitHub repository, you create a backup of your project and make it accessible to collaborators who have been granted access. This ensures that your code is safe even if your local machine encounters issues."

The focus is on GA1 and GA2 because of the approaching deadline. Basic knowledge will suffice; how deep you go is up to you. The biggest challenge is usually reading and understanding documentation. These sessions are designed to help you overcome that hurdle.\nQ2: What is the tool to create the API?\nA2:\nFastAPI. It will be demonstrated in this session.\nQ3: Will there be a review of the previous sessions?\nA3:\nRecordings are available on the YouTube playlist. Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today.\nQ4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do?\nA4:\nNGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time.\nQ5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround?\nA5:\nYou can do it without a premium version. The only time you might have an issue is if you’re using Codespaces and run out of the 125-hour limitation. Students have free access to GitHub.\nQ6: What is the tool to create the API?\nA6:\nFastAPI.\nQ7: Are the scores from the initial check (9/10 or 10/10) final, or will they be evaluated after submission?\nA7:\nWhatever you last submitted is your final score.\nQ8: In GA1, question 2 says to submit only the JSON body, not the headers. But if I don’t submit headers, it shows an error. What should I do?\nA8:\nThis will be addressed toward the end of the session.\nQ9: When running UVicorn on WSL, there are no issues. But on Windows, it seems there’s an issue with anti-something, some shielders, or something on my computer, flagging it and preventing it from running. What should I do?\nA9:\nMost web infrastructure runs on Linux servers (maybe 80%). These tools are designed with Linux in mind, and later ported to Windows. There will be some issues running them on Windows. You can get Linux in Windows now using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You need at least 8 GB of RAM to run it with reasonable performance. Anything less won’t work or will work poorly. If you can, install WSL; it’s worth it. Then these tools will work out of the box.\nQ10: What is CI/CD?\nA10:\nContinuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It automates tasks such as compiling, running, and sending code to devices. It reduces the time lag between finding a bug, fixing it, and pushing the fix to the devices that need it. This is useful in data science when pulling data from various places and quickly integrating findings into a workflow.\nQ11: What is Vercel?\nA11:\nVercel is a platform to deploy applications. You can deploy quickly and easily, and it automatically rebuilds when you push an update. You can deploy directly from your GitHub repo.\nQ12: What is the difference between Docker run and Docker compose?\nA12:\nDocker compose is for local testing. You can create a local network, give it a name, and test with four or five containers. For larger deployments, use Swarm (provided by Docker), Kubernetes, or Mesos.\nQ13: Can we wrap our MAD1 and MAD2 projects using Docker?\nA13:\nYes, that’s possible.\nQ14: Is there a demo where all the tools are used in a single project?\nA14:\nThere will be a separate session for the project, towards the end of this week or the beginning of next week. This session will show how all the tools fit together.\nQ15: If someone goes through CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and REST API, will that cover 50% of the course?\nA15:\nYes, roughly. The core technologies (REST APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) haven’t changed much in 30 years. Learning these will give you a foundation to learn other tools more easily. The course will also spend significant time on LLMs and how they fit into the workflow."

Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies.\nQ2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?\nA2:\nYes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools.\nQ3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?\nA3:\nYes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don’t need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task.\nQ4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?\nA4:\nFor the Llama file, you don’t need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab.\nQ5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I’m getting a 404 error. Why?\nA5:\nA 404 error means the page isn’t found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging.\nQ6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer. Why?\nA6:\nPost a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum. This will allow the instructor to check the backend and the script to determine the cause.\nQ7: Are the graded assignments open internet or closed internet?\nA7:\nAll graded assignments are open internet, except for the final in-person exam, which is closed internet.\nQ8: I’m having trouble signing into GitHub with my IIT email. Is GitHub only available for personal emails?\nA8:\nGitHub is available for any email. You need to sign up first, then sign in. For evaluation purposes, your submissions will be linked to the email address you use to log in. The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email.\nQ9: For the GitHub question, if I’ve signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem?\nA9:\nThere shouldn’t be a problem. The instructor recommends using your IIT email for evaluation purposes.\nQ10: In the graded assignment 2, image compression, I’m getting an error: “Could not process the image. Is it browser supported? Image pixels do not match the original.” I’ve tried several ways, including using Photoshop to ensure the image resolution is the same. What’s wrong?\nA10:\nThe image size should be less than 1,300,000 bytes. The instructor will make a note of this issue and investigate. The error may be browser-related, so trying a different browser might help. The instructor also requests the Discourse link be shared.\nQ11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default?\nA11:\nThe TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added. It’s not a separate project like in other courses.\nQ12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade?\nA12:\nNo, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise.\nQ13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form?\nA13:\nYes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository.\nQ14: I’m using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I’m not getting the correct answers. Is it possible to install a Windows system in Linux?\nA14:\nYou can use WSL. The instructor asks for a screenshot to debug the issue. The student explains that they copied the files (a.txt and b.txt) to a TDS folder in their Ubuntu WSL environment. The\ndiff\ncommand shows 40 lines of difference, but the submission is not accepted. The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum.\nQ15: Question 16 in GA1 (rename files) is not accepting my answer, even though I’ve tried using ChatGPT. What’s wrong?\nA15:\nThe instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum with your email ID. The instructor notes that many submissions are randomized, so the issue may be related to the specific randomized version of the question."

The\ndiff\ncommand shows the differences between two files directly.\ngit diff\ncompares commits in a git repository.\nQ2: I’m having trouble viewing my GA1. It’s showing zero ones. Can you help?\nA2:\nLet’s look at your screen. It appears there are different timestamps. I’ll help you troubleshoot.\nQ3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line?\nA3:\nI used a bash script that combines the\nfind\ncommand (to locate files of a specific type, like\n.txt\nfiles) and the\nmv\ncommand (to move them). The\nfind\ncommand searches the current directory (\n./\n) for files (\n-type f\n) and the\n-exec\noption executes the\nmv\ncommand on each file found. The curly braces\n{}\nare placeholders for the filenames.\nQ4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course?\nA4:\nYou’ll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data. We’re not covering a full DBMS course. A good resource to learn more is SQLZoo. While you might not need more than six commands for this course, ChatGPT can help if you encounter more complex SQL queries.\nQ5: How can I deploy a Flask application to Vercel?\nA5:\nFirst, set up a git repository and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using\npython -m venv <env_name>\n. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g.,\n.\\env\\Scripts\\activate\n). Install Flask using\npip install flask\n. Create a\n.gitignore\nfile to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a\nvercel.json\nfile with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub. Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub. This is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).\nQ6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?\nA6:\nWhen deploying to Vercel, the port number you use locally doesn’t matter because Vercel will assign your application its own domain. You should remove\ndebug=True\nfrom your Flask application before deploying to production.\nQ7: Why do I need administrator permissions to use ngrok?\nA7:\nngrok is a command-line tool that forwards requests to your local host. It doesn’t need to be installed in your virtual environment. However, you might need administrator privileges to forward requests through a port. If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as administrator.\nQ8: What is ngrok and how does it work?\nA8:\nngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it’s running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.\nQ9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?\nA9:\nA virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project. This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool. You can install libraries (like Flask and Pandas) within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python packages.\nQ10: What is the assignment?\nA10:\nCreate a Flask application that takes a user’s birth month as input and returns their zodiac sign. This is a fun exercise to improve your Flask skills. You can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify and share the link. Remember to create a\n.gitignore\nfile to exclude the virtual environment folder."

We’ll also have extra sessions this week, and we’re hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let’s focus on today’s session.\nQ2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?\nA2:\nNo need to ask it again. I’ll look at the forum later.\nQ3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?\nA3:\nNot really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools.\nQ4: What is the concept behind Project One?\nA4:\nProject One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM.\nQ5: What kind of tasks can I expect?\nA5:\nThere are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system’s ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: “run” and “read”. The “run” endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The “read” endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file.\nQ6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren’t showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?\nA6:\nI’ll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They’re from this section.\nQ7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?\nA7:\nBased on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it.\nQ8: I’m struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?\nA8:\nYes, we’ll do that in future sessions. We’ll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you’re thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there’s a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We’ll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics.\nQ9: I’m having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?\nA9:\nYes, we’ll provide as much support as possible. We’ll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you’re struggling with Git, you won’t be able to do the project, as it’s a prerequisite. We’ll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it’s done.\nQ10: What’s required for grading?\nA10:\nYour repository must meet these criteria:\nIt must exist and be publicly accessible.\nIt must have a license file (MIT license).\nIt must have a valid Dockerfile.\nThe Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command.\nThe Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository.\nIt doesn’t have to be publicly accessible while you’re developing it. Just make sure it’s public when you submit. These are absolute prerequisites; if any fail, your project won’t be evaluated.\nQ11: What is the grading scheme?\nA11:\nPhase A is worth 10 marks, and Phase B is worth 10 marks. You get one mark for each task completed in Phase A and one for each task in Phase B. There are also bonus marks for additional tasks and code diversity. Last term, there were 12 bonus marks, and the highest score was 7 or 8 out of 12.\nQ12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?\nA12:\nNo, we don’t penalize copying. We want you to learn. We encourage you to learn from each other, but we’ll reward unique code.\nQ13: How do I use the OpenAI LLM?\nA13:\nYou’ll use it through a proxy. You’ll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We’ll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code.\nQ14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI?\nA14:\nAll IITM students (including BS students) have free access to the Pro version of Perplexity AI for one year. Use your IITM email address to register.\nQ15: In the LLM section, the prompt engineering section mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven’t used it even once. The key was generated, but I didn’t use it. What should I do?\nA15:\nWe’ll cover this in a later session.\nQ16: The textbox in question 3 doesn’t appear. I think there’s a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it’s not being accepted. Should I refresh?\nA16:\nWe’ll cover this in a later session.\nQ17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project. I couldn’t find the video. Is there one?\nA17:\nYes, at the beginning of this session, we discussed the requirements for Project One. We’ll upload this video in a few hours or early tomorrow.\nQ18: Will there be support for those not well-versed in Git and GitHub?\nA18:\nYes, we’ll provide support. We’ll also go through a working prototype in future sessions.\nQ19: Is the week two content completely covered in the sessions?\nA19:\nYes, but the way we covered it is a bit different. We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts.\nQ20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven’t received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don’t understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?\nA20:\nRegarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.\nQ21: So, for this one, I don’t get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else?\nA21:\nYou just say “yes” here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark.\nQ22: Why isn’t it reflecting?\nA22:\nIt may be because you haven’t pushed to GitHub yet.\nQ23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven’t used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?\nA23:\nNo, you don’t need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn’t give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API.\nQ24: I’ve used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can’t I?\nA24:\nThe free OpenAI account doesn’t give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens.\nQ25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?\nA25:\nNo need to share your screen. I’ll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That’s how your project will have to work.\nQ26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay?\nA26:\nNo, you don’t have to pay.\nQ27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?\nA27:\nYes, we’ll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due.\nQ28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend. Is that wrong?\nA28:\nYes, it’s due this weekend, but we’ll have three more sessions before then.\nQ29: I have another question. Is it okay to ask now?\nA29:\nSure.\nQ30: I submitted my answers, but I don’t know if I did it correctly. There’s nothing to submit here. I just say “yes”?\nA30:\nYou just say “yes” and submit to the URL. It will pick up the API itself.\nQ31: Why isn’t it reflecting?\nA31:\nIt may be because you haven’t pushed to GitHub yet.\nQ32: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven’t received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don’t understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?\nA32:\nFor question 10, you need to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. For question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.\nQ33: What are some other core concepts that are important to understand?\nA33:\nBefore I talk about those, let’s start with a simple example of how to make an API call to an LLM. API calls are powerful because you can use them in your programs.\nQ34: How do I get my API key?\nA34:\nYou can find the link to get your proxy token on the GitHub page. I’ll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs.\nQ35: What is a proxy?\nA35:\nOpenAI provides the service, but you don’t interact with them directly. Anand has purchased tokens from OpenAI and provides access via a proxy. The proxy acts as a middleman between you and OpenAI.\nQ36: How many tokens does a prompt take?\nA36:\nThe prompt we used took 32 tokens. The response (“negative”) took two tokens. The total was 34 tokens. This cost us 1/10,000 of a dollar. Keep track of your token usage.\nQ37: How can I keep track of token usage?\nA37:\nKeep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient.\nQ38: How are API calls made?\nA38:\nYou’ll need a URL, headers (including authorization), and a JSON payload. The payload includes the model, messages, and response format. The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output.\nQ39: Can you share the notebook file?\nA39:\nNo, we don’t typically share the notebook file itself, as it prevents you from fully grasping the concepts. However, a sample file is available.\nQ40: What about function calling?\nA40:\nWe’ll cover function calling in a later session. It’s a key part of the project. Function calling allows your LLM to decide which function to call based on the prompt. We’ll use last term’s Project Two to demonstrate.\nQ41: What about embeddings?\nA41:\nEmbeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We’ll demonstrate this in a future session.\nQ42: What about text extraction?\nA42:\nWe’ll cover this in a future session.\nQ43: What about Base64 encoding?\nA43:\nWe’ll cover this in a future session. It’s how you send images to the API.\nQ44: I’ve seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that?\nA44:\nYes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would send it as a Base64 encoded URI. We’ll cover this in a future session.\nQ45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?\nA45:\nYes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we’ve put this together for you. We’ll also demonstrate and do working examples.\nQ46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I’ve already told the TA, but haven’t received a response.\nA46:\nThe Wednesday session cannot be moved. The Thursday session might be possible, but the sessions are generally kept in the evening because many students work during the day. We record all sessions, so you can view them later. We can try to schedule an earlier doubt-clearing session, perhaps on Friday, but I’ll have to discuss it with the team. What time on Friday works for you?"

How do I rejoin with my IITM ID?\nA1:\nYou need to rejoin the session using your IITM ID. We don’t allow anyone to join without their IITM ID.\nQ2: Today’s session is mostly about doubt clearing. I haven’t seen the GAs yet. Can I come tomorrow after I’ve solved them?\nA2:\nTomorrow and the day after, we will mostly be covering content, so there won’t be much scope for doubt clearing. We can address doubts towards the end of the session or while discussing a specific topic if the doubt relates to that topic.\nQ3: Will the sessions cover content relevant to GA2?\nA3:\nNo, the content will be relevant to GA3. The deadline for GA3 has been pushed to Wednesday.\nQ4: GA2 content looks straightforward. If I have any doubts after the sessions, I’ll ask then.\nA4:\nThat would be great.\nQ5: I was confused about the image compression in [unclear]. I tried to copy the code and run it in Colab, but it asked for third-party authentication. I wasn’t sure what it was asking, so I pulled back.\nA5:\nI haven’t used the code for solving that particular image compression question; I only used the provided website. I tried using the code, but it gave me an error about dimensions not matching the original file’s dimensions. That’s why I used the web application. There is a specific use case for this. Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won’t spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective. In a particular video, they talked about how 50-51% of information on web pages is in image format, so reducing image size is important. From a project perspective, it won’t be that relevant in future weeks.\nQ6: I tried to do Git commits from my CLI, but based on the given ID, a new repository was created. I want to use the one I created for GA1. How can I make sure that whatever changes I’m making get committed to the repository I signed up for?\nA6:\nPlease share your screen. (The instructor then appears to have difficulty understanding the question.)\nQ7: I have a doubt in question 4. Actually, I’ve done the Vercel file for question 6 (What is the Vercel URL?). I’m uploading that URL, but it’s not showing that it’s up. Can I share my screen?\nA7:\nYes, please share your screen. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the code, going to the Vercel dashboard, and appending\n/api\nto the URL. The issue is that the Flask module is not installed on Vercel. The instructor suggests using a capital ‘F’ in\nFlask\nin the requirements.txt file. The instructor also suggests using GitHub, where a requirements.txt file is not needed.)\nQ8: In the FastAPI question, I’m pushing the website, but it’s not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It’s also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?\nA8:\nRegarding the Vercel question, you can mention a capital ‘F’ for Flask, but I think it won’t install because… I’ve just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don’t have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it’s connected to GitHub, you don’t need the requirements file. Something else is the issue. It’s not able to pull the Flask module. You should not have to install it separately while running the file. I used\nhttp.server\n. There’s example code given in GA2 itself for question 6. There’s sample code there that uses\nhttp.server\n. I just modified that bit and put my function in there, and it works without any issues. The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request. You don’t need a separate\nrequirements.txt\nfile; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That’s one thing you’ll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there’s a logic error in your code. It shouldn’t fetch all of it. Your query actually says\nclass\n(CLASSS) without an underscore. If you put an underscore there, it will probably give you the correct response.\nQ9: I’m getting an error in question 10 of GA2. (Student shares screen.)\nA9:\nPlease close the picture-in-picture; it won’t disconnect the session. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including copying the error and posting it on Discourse and tagging Anand. The instructor suggests using the ngrok URL (the one in front of forwarding in the terminal). The error is a Cloudflare error. The instructor suggests copying the error and sending it on Discourse and tagging Anand.)\nQ10: I wanted to say that while installing ngrok with the terminal, I wasn’t able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here…\nA10:\nIt shouldn’t matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you’re getting a Cloudflare error, I’m not entirely sure. That’s normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We’ll have to check with Anand what the issue is.\nQ11: Is my screen visible? In the Vercel question, sometimes it shows correctly, and now it’s showing an error. It’s showing correctly again. I don’t know why this happens. The score also…\nA11:\nThere was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it’s been fixed now. That’s why you’re not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse. It shouldn’t give you a problem anymore.\nQ12: One more thing: in the FastAPI question, I’m pushing the website, but it’s not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It’s also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?\nA12:\nThe issue is likely in your code’s logic. You should try to fix the code. The word\nclass\nitself is a keyword in Python, so you’ll have to find a workaround that enables you to use a query called\nclass\n(CLASSS) without the underscore.\nQ13: One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I’m giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I’ll show you that. Should I run this first?\nA13:\nBefore we do that, let’s see what error comes out. You haven’t put the actual correct URL, right? Just add\n/api\n. It’s because this particular Flask module is not installed on Vercel. You should use the\nrequests\nmodule instead of the\ncurl\ncommand. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don’t match OpenAI’s. It might have been a coincidence that it worked for 3.5. If you use the documentation that Anand has provided, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token… You’ll have to provide the documentation in this form. You’ll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.\nQ14: In question 5, I’ve enabled it, but I’m getting an “unexpected end of JSON input” error. I’m not sure why. I’ve tried different structures for the JSON.\nA14:\nCopy this JSON to VS Code and save it as a JSON file. VS Code will parse it so you can see it better. At the bottom, you have an extra required address and additional properties that are not necessary. That shouldn’t cause it to be invalid JSON. Try without that. Just remove that extra bit and try without it.\nQ15: One more thing: in FastAPI question 9, I’m giving the URL, but it’s giving me the whole data. Even when I add conditions, it shows the whole data. I’ll show you. Should I run this first?\nA15:\nAdd\n/api\nat the end of that. That’s some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There’s some logic error. You’re getting a Cloudflare error. That’s something to do with the CDN service giving some sort of response. We’ll have to check with Anand.\nQ16: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly earlier, and now it’s showing an error. And look, it’s showing correctly again. I don’t know why this happens. The score also…\nA16:\nAt the moment, it’s working, right? There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it’s been fixed now. That’s why you’re not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse.\nQ17: I’m getting an error from this. I don’t know how…\nA17:\nIn the ninth question, you’re getting an error. Earlier, it was working fine. You’ll need to… this is the Vercel one, right? No, this is the FastAPI one. You’ll have to run the server for that. You should post this on Discourse. Just copy that whole error message itself and put it in a notepad or something, and then post on Discourse.\nQ18: One more thing I wanted to say: actually, I’m not… while installing ngrok with this terminal, I wasn’t able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here…\nA18:\nIt shouldn’t matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you’re getting a Cloudflare error, I’m not entirely sure. That’s normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We’ll have to check with Anand what the issue is.\nQ19: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly, and now it’s showing an error. And look, it’s showing correctly again. I don’t know why this happens. The score also…\nA19:\nIt looks like a Cloudflare error. I’ve noted this error. It is from Cloudflare. You could just try again. When did you try this, apart from just now? You got the same error yesterday as well? Yeah, so that’s some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There is some logic error.\nQ20: Should I install it separately?\nA20:\nNo, you won’t require requirements for it. Vercel is able to run the program without that.\nQ21: For Vercel, I will take the example code and try to run it. One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I’m giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I’ll show you that.\nA21:\nYou should use the requests module and send a request using headers and all those informations. What you are using is actually OpenAI’s own library, and that will not work. You will have to use the requests module and send the request just like the examples shown. There will be a URL, a header, and a payload. If you use their own library, it will not construct it correctly. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don’t match OpenAI’s. For 3.5, it worked, but that was more of a coincidence. If you use the documentation that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided, there’s documentation there. If you use that documentation, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token… You’ll have to provide the documentation in this form. You’ll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.\nQ22: This was in ROE last term. I’m getting an error. How?\nA22:\nThis was a really fascinating question. There is a way, in fact many ways, to get it to say yes. You just have to trick it into saying yes. Just look up previous Discourse posts; you will probably find suggestions on there as well.\nQ23: Can I get the code for this?\nA23:\nHe will… didn’t he provide that in a Discourse post? Someone has pasted it on Discourse. If not, we can always ask him to provide it.\nQ24: I’ve taken one more course, something on business BA or something like that. There is no GA at all for this. There is a GA, but you don’t submit here. These two courses are somewhat different.\nA24:\nRight, right.\nQ25: When I joined (late), an ngrok error was being shown by someone. I’m also getting a very similar error. I couldn’t follow the discussion at all. I joined towards the end. Shall I share my screen?\nA25:\nJust before you share your screen, was it giving you a Cloudflare error? (The student describes the error.) You can share your screen. I think your problem is slightly different. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the ngrok URL and restarting the Lama server. The issue is that ngrok is running outside of the Ubuntu environment, and the Lama server is running inside the Ubuntu environment. The instructor suggests installing ngrok in the Windows machine and then creating a tunnel from there. The student tries this, but it’s still giving an error. The instructor then suggests using the directly executable file for ngrok.)\nQ26: I tried all this, same issue. I’m getting an error. I think I’ve tried all this, same issue.\nA26:\nThe account is limited to one simultaneous session. You’ve got another session running somewhere. I think that is inside VS WSL. You’ll have to stop that. You’ll have to check for that. The output that your code is generating is wrong. It’s generating null, null, which is wrong. Just try to check for… can you go back to the question once? It is sending some URL-encoded parameter. There might be a mistake while reading those parameters. Just changing that code will help. There’s a problem with my code where it’s fetching null for all the data, which it should not. You can either ask on Discourse or try to fix it yourself."

The Flask module is not getting downloaded. Can you show the vercel.json configuration file?\nA2:\nThe error likely stems from your\nrequirements.txt\nfile. Did you create a new virtual environment for this project, or did you install Flask on your global environment? When deploying Flask applications on Vercel, you need to keep a few things in mind. I’ll show you how to create a\nrequirements.txt\nfile without manually typing it.\nQ3: I added a requirements.txt file with Flask and Flask-Cors, but Kartal sir said I could use the example in the question. Should I remove the requirements.txt file and rewrite the code? The code is working, but I’m getting a null output instead of a list of integers as requested.\nA3:\nLet’s see your screen. The Flask application might be running fine as intended, but you might not be seeing the output. Sharing your screen would help me understand what’s happening. You are getting a null output because you are not using a virtual environment. Let’s create one.\nQ4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version?\nA4:\nYes, you have to specify the version. But you don’t have to manually type the\nrequirements.txt\nfile. You can use a single-line command in Python:\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n. This will create the file with all the libraries and their versions in your virtual environment (or global environment if you don’t have a virtual environment).\nQ5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I’m using Vercel CLI.\nA5:\nLet’s try\npython -m venv venv\nin PowerShell. If you are using a virtual environment, it will only return the libraries specifically present in that environment. Since you are currently using a global environment, it returns every library.\nQ6: Have you tried the optional exercise I gave you for the Flask API (Zodiac sign one)?\nA6:\nNo one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person’s month of birth and return their zodiac sign.\nQ7: The main problem is that I’m spending almost 2-3 days on the TDS assignments. The GAs have 10-18 questions on average.\nA7:\nI understand. The GAs are time-consuming. If you get some time and are in the mood, you can work on the optional mini-project. You can have many more types of ideas and execute them using Flask API.\nQ8: Currently, I’m not in the directory that contains the Vercel file (vercel.json).\nA8:\nI’m just demonstrating how to create the\nrequirements.txt\nfile.\nQ9: If I’m running a virtual environment with\nuv\n, will it only copy out the tools that are in the virtual environment?\nA9:\nExactly. That’s a downside of\nuv\n. When using\nuv\n, you are not installing those libraries. If they are not installed, they won’t be present in your virtual environment, and therefore won’t be in your\nrequirements.txt\nfile. For minor projects that you don’t need to deploy,\nuv\nis fine. Otherwise, create a virtual environment and install the libraries there.\nQ10: Now it’s showing nothing. I don’t know why.\nA10:\nYour server is not running. Run\nvercel deploy --prod\nagain. I’m not a big fan of Vercel CLI; I usually push to GitHub and then establish a connection between Vercel and GitHub. Let’s open the dev tools (right-click, inspect), go to the console, and reload. Show me your code.\nQ11: I’m using httpx.\nA11:\nYesterday, I told you that you can use the example file from the question. That’s why you rewrote the code. Otherwise, you would have created the\nrequirements.txt\nfile and deployed both. This was working yesterday; now it’s showing blank. Can you show me the code?\nQ12: It was working perfectly yesterday. Now it’s showing blank. An error page is showing. Sir told me to add\n/api\nto the URL, and it would show some data. When I entered that link in the assignment, it gave me a null list.\nA12:\nThat’s what happens when nothing is showing. Can you scroll down? You’re using CORS. You’ve used a lot of complexity; you’ve made it a lot more complex. You took help from ChatGPT. That explains the comments. It’s not directing you somewhere. The JSON file is not present in the API folder. Let’s go to line 5 of your code. Add\n../\nbefore\nq\nto include the parent directory. Save and redeploy.\nQ13: Should I remove the\n.vercel\nfolder and redeploy?\nA13:\nNo, that won’t work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.\nQ14: Are the vercel.json and everything inside the API file?\nA14:\nNo, they are in the\nvercel-python/api\ndirectory.\nQ15: I don’t know how to use\nclass\nas a variable name in question 9.\nA15:\nclass\nis a keyword in Python. You can’t use it as a variable name. I’ll explain how to handle this. You need a different variable name. I used an alias. I’ll explain what that means.\nQ16: When passing multiple parameters with the same name, how do I handle it?\nA16:\nYou need to use lists. Import\nList\nfrom the\ntyping\nlibrary. I got this from ChatGPT. Always learn from ChatGPT, but also learn from the process. The query will take all the strings and put them into one list. The default value is used if no parameter is passed. An alias is another name for a variable. The variable name is\nclassName\n, but we can use the\nclass\nparameter using this alias.\nQ17: My code was working correctly except for the name. I don’t know how to write it.\nA17:\nYou are using\nhttpx\n. You’re also using\nindex.py\n. This is not Flask-based; it’s more like an HTTP server.\nQ18: I’ll try to do it again according to the requirements and add the requirements.txt file. After that, I’ll share my screen.\nA18:\nOkay, you can do that. The Flask-based code is not needed here.\nQ19: I’m confused because it was working perfectly (or at least working) yesterday.\nA19:\nCan you open Vercel again? Yesterday, was this particular box showing “Not Found”? When you added\n/api\nto the URL, it showed a dictionary. It was returning a JSON object. Show me your folder structure.\nQ20: I created the directory, then another folder\napi\n, and then\nindex.py\ninside\napi\n.\nA20:\nShould I remove the\n.vercel\nfolder and redeploy? No, that won’t work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.\nQ21: Show your folder structure.\nA21:\nI created the directory, then another folder\napi\n, and then\nindex.py\ninside\napi\n.\nQ22: If I use\nuv\n, will it only copy the tools in the virtual environment?\nA22:\nYes.\nQ23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system?\nA23:\nI don’t think that will save space on your local system because you have to create files locally before pushing them to Git.\nQ24: Can we use the query function?\nA24:\nYes, absolutely. It’s working like this. I’ll comment it out, duplicate it, and comment it out once. Then we can run this. The query function is working. We have got the entire row where the city was. We can extract the population using this. It’s working perfectly fine. It returned the population of Delhi.\nQ25: Do we need to mention values [square bracket] zero, values zero, if we are mentioning population only?\nA25:\nThat’s a very good question. If you use this, it will return a series (a Pandas term). It’s just a column; it won’t give you the exact value. We have to extract the zeroth value. We have to extract the values.\nvalues\nwill return this.\nQ26: Question 9: I don’t know how to use\nclass\nas a variable name.\nA26:\nclass\nis a keyword. You can’t use it as a variable name. Create a different variable name. I used an alias.\nQ27: Question 6: Can you take the last of the class now, or should I wait?\nA27:\nLet’s arrange a separate meeting to discuss this. I’ll also look into your file. You can share it on Discourse or email it to me.\nQ28: Can we use\nhttpie\ninstead of\nrequests\n?\nA28:\nYes, you can change it to\nhttpx\n.\nhttpie\nis a command-line tool, not a Python module. I’m not sure about\nhttpie\n.\nQ29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?\nA29:\nNo, it won’t get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for\nbiycle\n.\nQ30: Can we get a 3x1,1056 dimensional array?\nA30:\nYou won’t get it directly, but you can store it in whatever format you want. You can store it in an array. I don’t know how to convert JSON to an array.\nQ31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad?\nA31:\nSure. Let’s say I’m using a certain model for creating embeddings. Let’s say that model contains a billion words. It will check the similarity of a word (like “kitten”) with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that’s the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it’s checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That’s how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there’s a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called\nword2vec\n. It’s deployed on Hugging Face.\nQ32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?\nA32:\nI think it’s been removed. It would be too heavy for TDS.\nQ33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?\nA33:\nNot exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words. For example, let’s say we have the word “Anand”.\nQ34: Sorry for interrupting, but is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?\nA34:\nI think it’s been removed, probably because it’s too heavy for the course.\nQ35: My next question is why are these vectors (embeddings) so long? It’s just a word. For a paragraph, it must be thousands of variables.\nA35:\nIt won’t be. We’re getting embeddings from OpenAI. We’ll always get embeddings of the same length. It uses 1,536 numbers to represent a word. These are different features of the word. It might involve the shape of a bicycle. Does it involve SVD? It must be doing SVD.\nQ36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?\nA36:\nYou can try. It should work. Anything similar to “bicycle” should work.\nQ37: My last question is how can we pass multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately?\nA37:\nI think this is the way you can pass multiple words. This should get us two different vectors. It’s a list. The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle.\nQ38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?\nA38:\nNo, it won’t get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for\nbiycle\n.\nQ39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face?\nA39:\nWe can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won’t be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only.\nQ40: My first doubt is, can we use\nhttpie\ninstead of\nrequests\n?\nA40:\nYes, you can change it to\nhttpx\n. I’m not sure about\nhttpie\n. It’s a command-line tool. I’ve never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn’t matter much because it’s just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don’t know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it’s possible to use it in Python, but I don’t know.\nrequests\nis better. If it’s complicated, it’s not a good tool. At the end, it’s also using the\nrequests\nmodule.\nQ41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long?\nA41:\nThat’s the dimension it uses to represent a word. A higher dimension means better representation, but it requires more storage. You can think of them as a vector space, like a 3D space. Instead of representing a word in 3D, we’re representing it in 1,536 dimensions. These are different features of the word. One might represent shape.\nQ42: Does it involve SVD?\nA42:\nI don’t know the exact algorithm OpenAI uses to calculate embeddings. You can search on Google or ask ChatGPT. You can also ask ChatGPT for code completion.\nQ43: Question 9: Three different documents. For example, these are three different documents. You can think of them as paragraphs or words. The purpose is to figure out which word is related to the query word. One could be cat, one could be dog, and the other could be elephant. The query word could be kitten. You have to figure out which word relates more to it. The way to do it is using embeddings.\nA43:\nYou would have to figure out the embedding for each one of them. The way to compare two words is to compute the dot product. Cosine similarity is the dot product divided by the norm of each vector. OpenAI returns normalized vectors. The cosine similarity between “bicycle” and “cycle” would be higher than between “bicycle” and “apple”. That’s how computers store this information."

We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function.\nQ2: What is the first step in the process?\nA2:\nFirst, we import the\nrequests\nlibrary. Then, we’ll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we’ll create a JSON body for the request.\nQ3: What is the goal of the program?\nA3:\nThe program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user’s order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders.\nQ4: How will the program understand the user’s prompt?\nA4:\nThe program will send the user’s prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI will use its function calling capabilities to identify the appropriate function to call from a predefined set of functions within your application, and return the function name and parameters in a JSON format.\nQ5: What are the predefined functions?\nA5:\nThe predefined functions are a set of tools your application provides. Examples include\nget_weather_info\n(which takes a location as a parameter) and\nbest_hotels\n(which also takes a location). OpenAI will determine which function to call based on the user’s prompt.\nQ6: How does OpenAI determine which function to call?\nA6:\nOpenAI analyzes the user’s prompt and, based on its understanding of the context and semantics, selects the appropriate function from the predefined set. The response from OpenAI will include the function name and its required parameters in JSON format.\nQ7: How does the program use the OpenAI response?\nA7:\nYour application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application.\nQ8: Is the\norder\nfunction dependent on the above-written cell?\nA8:\nYes, the\norder\nfunction uses variables defined in previous cells.\nQ9: How is the JSON response handled?\nA9:\nThe JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function.\nQ10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn’t provide complete information?\nA10:\nYou can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application’s design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data.\nQ11: How can we integrate a voice model?\nA11:\nYou can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application.\nQ12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application?\nA12:\nWe’ll demonstrate this in a future session by creating another function and packaging the entire application into a Docker image.\nQ13: What is the role of prompt engineering in this process?\nA13:\nPrompt engineering is less about a specific science and more about understanding how the system works to write effective prompts that yield the desired results. The course will cover this in more detail.\nQ14: What if the\norder\nfunction doesn’t work as expected?\nA14:\nThe instructor suggests checking the code, ensuring the correct parameters are passed, and handling potential errors gracefully. The instructor also suggests using\njson.loads\nto convert strings to JSON objects.\nQ15: What is the duration of the Review of Exercises (ROE)?\nA15:\nThe ROE duration varies from term to term, ranging from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. It’s recommended to save your work frequently.\nQ16: What if the user’s prompt is missing information?\nA16:\nThe instructor suggests adding a system prompt to OpenAI to explicitly request missing parameters.\nQ17: How do we handle the\nUUID\ngeneration to ensure uniqueness?\nA17:\nThe\nUUID\nlibrary generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation.\nQ18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application?\nA18:\nInstead of using absolute paths (\nos.path\n), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments. For deployed applications, you would typically use a\n.env\nfile to store sensitive information like API keys.\nQ19: What is the overall approach to building this application?\nA19:\nThe approach is to use OpenAI’s function calling capabilities to translate natural language prompts into structured data that your application can process. This allows for a more natural user experience without the need for a complex UI. The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding how to parse JSON responses and handle errors."

Notebooks are great for sharing with others who may not understand the code, as you can add Markdown to explain each step.\nQ2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?\nA2:\nThat’s a good question. This application isn’t built to be very robust. The goal is to demonstrate GPT’s ability to convert natural language into functions that the application understands. A real-world application would have a more robust interface (website or local app) with precisely crafted inputs to map to functions, preventing such errors.\nQ3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?\nA3:\nUse\nuv\n.\nuv\nis similar to Docker in that it handles dependencies without requiring manual management of virtual environments. You just specify your dependencies at the top of your code, and\nuv\nhandles everything else, including creating and disposing of the virtual environment. This is especially useful when dealing with many submissions with different package requirements, as seen in a previous project with nearly 700 submissions.\nQ4: How does the application know which function to run based on the user’s request?\nA4:\nYou send the user’s natural language request (prompt) and a list of your application’s capabilities to GPT. GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function.\nQ5: What is the purpose of\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n?\nA5:\nThis is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won’t run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin.\nQ6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?\nA6:\nNo, there’s no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren’t clean, as there’s no robust error handling.\nQ7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?\nA7:\nYou pass them in the URL itself. For example,\nlocalhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29\n. The application then reads the parameter from the URL.\nQ8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?\nA8:\nSeveral things could cause this. Ensure that:\nThe\nprices\ndictionary is defined globally, not within a function.\nThe prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time).\nThe application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity).\nYou are using the correct key in the JSON response (\n.keys()\n).\nQ9: How do I use Docker?\nA9:\nDocker creates lightweight, self-contained images that run inside a Docker engine. This isolates your application from the underlying system, making it portable and easy to deploy anywhere. You build the image using\npodman build -t tds-hello .\n(the\n.\nrefers to the current working directory). Then, you run it using\npodman run -it tds-hello bash\n. The\nbash\ncommand opens an interactive shell within the Docker container.\nQ10: What are the use cases for Docker?\nA10:\nDocker is useful for deploying applications to various environments without worrying about dependencies or system specifics. You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system. This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients.\nQ11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?\nA11:\nThe GA3 project will involve using the concepts covered today, but on a larger scale. You’ll need to create more robust error handling and focus on prompt engineering to ensure the LLM generates the correct code. A previous session covered the basics of LLM calls, tokenization, embeddings, and image URI encoding. Review that session and the material on prompt engineering to prepare. The goal is to create a self-writing program that uses the LLM to generate and correct code dynamically."

I’m trying to send a POST request, but it keeps showing “method not allowed”.\nA1:\nWhen you access a URL from a browser, it sends a GET request. To send a POST request, you need an extension like Thunder Client or Postman. Thunder Client doesn’t require a login, but Postman does. However, Thunder Client is now a paid service.\nQ2: Previously, I was seeing some things, but now I’m getting the “method not allowed” error. I don’t know why.\nA2:\nLet’s troubleshoot this. We’ll use Thunder Client.\nQ3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?\nA3:\nGo to the “Body” section in Thunder Client. Create a JSON object using curly braces\n{}\n. Then, refer to question 7 for the JSON object to copy and paste. Remove the three dots (…) from the copied JSON. Click the “Send” button.\nQ4: I’m getting an error: “API key client option must be set either by passing API key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.” Am I trying to access an OpenAI key?\nA4:\nYes, you are. Since you don’t have a\n.env\nfile, you need to create one. For now, comment out the code after line 172 and replace it with\nreturn \"hello\"\nto test. Restart the server.\nQ5: Thunder Client is not showing any paywall.\nA5:\nThunder Client has a free version with limitations (e.g., 15 collections and 15 requests).\nQ6: Earlier, Thunder Client was free. When did it change?\nA6:\nRecently.\nQ7: I’m still stuck. Can you spell “Thunder Client”?\nA7:\nT-H-U-N-D-E-R-C-L-I-E-N-T\nQ8: I’m still getting errors. What’s wrong?\nA8:\nLet’s review your code. You’re trying to send a request using the OpenAI module, which won’t work. You need to send the request through an API proxy.\nQ9: I tried using an API proxy, but I still got errors.\nA9:\nLet’s focus on getting the basic functionality working. We’ll create a simple application and send a POST request using Thunder Client.\nQ10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23?\nA10:\nThose lines are for allowing requests from external servers. You can list the servers you want to allow. If you use\n*\n, anyone can access the application. It’s better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from\nserver1\nand\nserver2\n, you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name.\nQ11: I’m stuck on the Docker part of the assignment.\nA11:\nLet’s review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository.\nQ12: I’m having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I’m trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it’s not working.\nA12:\nLet’s review the code. You’ll need to automate the process using an LLM. The LLM will generate the code, which you’ll then execute using the subprocess module in Python.\nQ13: Why do we need to use the subprocess module?\nA13:\nIn this project, you’ll receive tasks in different languages (English, Hindi, Urdu). The LLM will generate the code to handle these tasks. The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local machine.\nQ14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?\nA14:\nIf you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same.\nQ15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?\nA15:\nThat’s a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost.\nQ16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?\nA16:\nOfficially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes.\nQ17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?\nA17:\nIt sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let’s review your process.\nQ18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn’t enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).\nA18:\nFive hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming.\nQ19: For question 9, I’m trying to write a string that will make the AI say “yes,” but it’s not working. Can you give me some hints?\nA19:\nThat’s something you’ll have to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas.\nQ20: Can I do this using the command prompt, or is there a way to do it from the website?\nA20:\nYou can use the website, but you may need to use the command prompt for some tasks.\nQ21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don’t remember exactly what I did.\nA21:\nThat’s okay. Let’s focus on the current assignment.\nQ22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?\nA22:\nThe description will include the three lines of code you’ve already seen. These will be part of the request parameters.\nQ23: Why can’t I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?\nA23:\nThere might be other tasks that require different inputs.\nQ24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?\nA24:\nWe use the\nAllow-Origin\nheader to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use\n*\n, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure.\nQ25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?\nA25:\nThe trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call.\nQ26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?\nA26:\nIt can be any URL. The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL.\nQ27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?\nA27:\nThe subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM.\nQ28: For task 3, what is the expected output?\nA28:\nThe task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You’ll need to execute that code using the subprocess module.\nQ29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?\nA29:\nWe’ll prioritize project 1. We’ll discuss the timeline for project 4 later.\nQ30: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?\nA30:\nYou can compare the decoded image from both methods visually. The size and resolution should be the same. If the encoding is correct, the decoded image will match the original. You can also encode the image using an encoder to verify.\nQ31: In previous assignments, some answers disappeared after logging out. Can we still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?\nA31:\nOfficially, no. However, reviewing your answers can still be beneficial for learning.\nQ32: Can you give me some hints on how to write a prompt to make the AI in question 9 say “yes”?\nA32:\nThat’s something you’ll need to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas."

This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones.\nQ2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?\nA2:\nThis functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The\nIMPORTHTML\nfunction will give you a #NAME? error in Excel.\nQ3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?\nA3:\nI’ll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube.\nQ4: What do the parameters in the\nIMPORTHTML\nfunction mean?\nA4:\nThe four parameters are: URL, query (either “list” or “table”), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python).\nQ5: How does the\nIMPORTHTML\nfunction automatically find the table?\nA5:\nIt finds the table based on the index you provide. If there are multiple tables, you’ll need to adjust the index accordingly.\nQ6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn’t use a JSON object?\nA6:\nThere are three ways:\nMethod 1:\nIf the webpage uses a JSON object, you can extract it directly.\nMethod 2:\nUse query selectors in the browser’s console to extract the data. This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The\n$$\noperator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The\n.\nprefix selects elements by class, and\n#\nselects by ID.\nMethod 3:\nSometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser’s “Sources” tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data.\nQ7: What’s the difference between\ninnerText\nand\ninnerHTML\n?\nA7:\ninnerText\nreturns only the text content of an element, while\ninnerHTML\nreturns the entire HTML code within that element.\nQ8: I’m having trouble using the FastAPI in Chrome. I’ve posted on Discourse multiple times, but it’s still not working. The error is “Method Not Allowed”.\nA8:\nWhen using POST requests with FastAPI, you need to specify the method in the request. I’ll look into your Discourse post and get back to you. We can also schedule a separate meeting to discuss this further. The issue might be related to how your system interacts with the host (it might be localhost).\nQ9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?\nA9:\nThe scope is indeed broad. The project’s requirements are defined by Anand, who is also the CEO of a company. He’s busy, but you can contact him through Discourse. We can discuss the scope and tools further in a meeting. There is no sandbox environment for testing. The goal is to extract data, but the method is not specified. You can enhance the goal by using other tools (Autodesk, Blender, etc.), but the scope should be restricted by the QA team. We can discuss this further in a meeting."

However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease.\nQ2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday’s session?\nA2:\nIt’s already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video.\nQ3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?\nA3:\nFirst, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint.\nQ4: How do I access data from a JSON object in Python?\nA4:\nJSON objects are like Python dictionaries. You can access the data using standard Python dictionary access methods. The instructor shows how to access the “reports” key.\nQ5: How do I prepare for the upcoming R.O.E.?\nA5:\nThe instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready. Separate sessions will be held to cover this.\nQ6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data?\nA6:\nNominatim is an API used for extracting geolocation data. The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., “Delhi”) and specify the desired format (JSON). The instructor notes that Nominatim may return multiple results if there are multiple locations with the same name (e.g., Delhi in India and Delhi in the United States).\nQ7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?\nA7:\nThe instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to parse XML data from the Hacker News API. The instructor explains how to use the\nfind_all\nfunction to locate specific tags (e.g., “item”) and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between\nfind\nand\nfindall\nfunctions. The instructor notes that if you encounter issues, you can use an XML viewer to examine the structure of the XML file. The instructor also explains that you should use an XML parser (lxml) instead of an HTML parser.\nQ8: How do I handle situations where the number of values in different lists doesn’t match?\nA8:\nIf the lengths of lists (e.g., product names, prices, links) don’t match, it usually means there’s an extra value. The instructor shows how to handle this by checking the lengths of the lists and potentially removing extra values.\nQ9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?\nA9:\nThe instructor demonstrates using the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the extracted data and then saving it to a CSV file using the\nto_csv\nmethod.\nQ10: How do I scrape data from multiple pages of a website?\nA10:\nMany websites allow scraping, but you should always check their terms and conditions. If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g.,\npage=2\nfor the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages.\nQ11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?\nA11:\nAlways check the website’s terms and conditions before scraping. Some websites can detect when requests are not coming from a browser and may block you. To avoid this, use a sleep timer between requests to give the server time to respond. Selenium is an alternative approach that simulates a browser, but it’s more involved than Beautiful Soup. The instructor mentions being banned from Nominatim for sending too many requests in a short time frame.\nQ12: How can I use Beautiful Soup to extract data from an e-commerce website?\nA12:\nThe instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to extract product names, prices, and links from an Amazon search result page. The instructor explains how to use the\nfind_all\nfunction to locate specific tags and attributes (e.g.,\nspan\nelements with a specific class) and extract the text content. The instructor also shows how to convert string prices to numerical values. The instructor notes that the order of elements is preserved when using Beautiful Soup, ensuring that data is correctly associated."

In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\nFor example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\nTool\nExtract from JSON…\nWhy\njq\nJSON in the shell\nQuick data exploration and pipeline processing\nJMESPath\nJSON in Python\nHandle complex queries with a clean syntax\nijson\nJSON streams in Python\nParse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently\nPandas\nJSON columns in Python\nFast analysis of structured data\nSQL JSON\nJSON in databases\nCombine structured and semi-structured data\nDuckDB\nJSON anywhere\nFast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory\nExamples:\nUse Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\nLeverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\nApply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\nPractice with these resources:\nJSONPath Online Evaluator\n: Test JSON queries\njq play\n: Interactive jq query testing\nDuckDB JSON Tutorial\n: Learn DuckDB JSON functions\nCommand-line JSON Processing with jq\njq\nis a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\nExample:\nSifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n# Extract specific fields from JSONL\ncat\ndata.jsonl\n|\njq\n-c\n'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n# Transform JSON structure\ncat\ndata.json\n|\njq\n'.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n# Filter and aggregate\ncat\nevents.jsonl\n|\njq\n-s\n'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nJMESPath Queries\nJMESPath\noffers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\nExample:\nExtracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\nimport\njmespath\n# Example queries\ndata\n=\n{\n\"locations\"\n:\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Seattle\"\n,\n\"state\"\n:\n\"WA\"\n,\n\"info\"\n:\n{\n\"population\"\n:\n737015\n}\n}\n,\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Portland\"\n,\n\"state\"\n:\n\"OR\"\n,\n\"info\"\n:\n{\n\"population\"\n:\n652503\n}\n}\n]\n}\n# Find all cities with population > 700000\ncities\n=\njmespath\n.\nsearch\n(\n\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\"\n,\ndata\n)\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nStreaming with ijson\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory.\nijson\nlets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\nExample:\nProcessing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\nimport\nijson\nasync\ndef\nprocess_large_json\n(\nfilepath\n:\nstr\n)\n-\n>\nlist\n:\n\"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\nresults\n=\n[\n]\nwith\nopen\n(\nfilepath\n,\n'rb'\n)\nas\nfile\n:\n# Stream objects under the 'items' key\nparser\n=\nijson\n.\nitems\n(\nfile\n,\n'items.item'\n)\nasync\nfor\nitem\nin\nparser\n:\nif\nitem\n[\n'value'\n]\n>\n100\n:\n# Process conditionally\nresults\n.\nappend\n(\nitem\n)\nreturn\nresults\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nPandas JSON Columns\nPandas\nmakes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\nExample:\nFlattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\nimport\npandas\nas\npd\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf\n=\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n(\n{\n'json_col'\n:\n[\n'{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}'\n,\n'{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}'\n]\n}\n)\ndf\n[\n'parsed'\n]\n=\ndf\n[\n'json_col'\n]\n.\napply\n(\npd\n.\njson_normalize\n)\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf\n=\npd\n.\nread_csv\n(\n'data.csv'\n)\ndf_normalized\n=\npd\n.\njson_normalize\n(\ndf\n[\n'nested_json'\n]\n.\napply\n(\njson\n.\nloads\n)\n,\nrecord_path\n=\n[\n'items'\n]\n,\n# List of nested objects to unpack\nmeta\n=\n[\n'id'\n,\n'timestamp'\n]\n# Keep these columns from parent\n)\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nSQL JSON Functions\nSQL\nsupports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, including\nSQLite\n,\nPostgreSQL\n, and\nMySQL\n.\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\nExample:\nAn application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\nSELECT\njson_extract\n(\ndata\n,\n'$.name'\n)\nas\nname\n,\njson_extract\n(\ndata\n,\n'$.details.age'\n)\nas\nage\nFROM\nusers\nWHERE\njson_extract\n(\ndata\n,\n'$.active'\n)\n=\ntrue\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nDuckDB JSON Processing\nDuckDB\nshines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\nExample:\nPerforming ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\nSELECT\njson_extract_string\n(\ndata\n,\n'$.user.name'\n)\nas\nname\n,\navg\n(\njson_extract_float\n(\ndata\n,\n'$.metrics.value'\n)\n)\nas\navg_value\nFROM\nread_json_auto\n(\n'data/*.jsonl'\n)\nGROUP\nBY\n1\nHAVING\navg_value\n>\n100\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied"

Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025.\nFor questions,\nuse this Discourse thread\n.\nBackground\nYou have joined the operations team at\nDataWorks Solutions\n, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.\nDue to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.\nYour assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain‑English tasks, carries out the required (multi‑step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre‑computed expected results.\nCreate an API\nWrite an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints:\nPOST\n/run?task=<task description>\nExecutes a plain‑English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output.\nIf successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response\nIf unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response\nIf unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response\nThe body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases\nGET\n/read?path=<file path>\nReturns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output.\nIf successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text\nIf the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body\nPhase A: Handle Operations Tasks\nThe DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated:\nA1\n. Install\nuv\n(if required) and run\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py\nwith\n${user.email}\nas the only argument. (\nNOTE\n: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)\nA2\n. Format the contents of\n/data/format.md\nusing\nprettier@3.4.2\n, updating the file in-place\nA3\n. The file\n/data/dates.txt\ncontains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to\n/data/dates-wednesdays.txt\nA4\n. Sort the array of contacts in\n/data/contacts.json\nby\nlast_name\n, then\nfirst_name\n, and write the result to\n/data/contacts-sorted.json\nA5\n. Write the first line of the 10 most recent\n.log\nfile in\n/data/logs/\nto\n/data/logs-recent.txt\n, most recent first\nA6\n. Find all Markdown (\n.md\n) files in\n/data/docs/\n. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with\n#\n). Create an index file\n/data/docs/index.json\nthat maps each filename (without the\n/data/docs/\nprefix) to its title (e.g.\n{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...}\n)\nA7\n.\n/data/email.txt\ncontains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender’s email address, and write just the email address to\n/data/email-sender.txt\nA8\n.\n/data/credit-card.png\ncontains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to\n/data/credit-card.txt\nA9\n.\n/data/comments.txt\ncontains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to\n/data/comments-similar.txt\n, one per line\nA10\n. The SQLite database file\n/data/ticket-sales.db\nhas a\ntickets\nwith columns\ntype\n,\nunits\n, and\nprice\n. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Write the number in\n/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt\nDevelopers will call the\n/run?task=\nendpoint with a task description\nsimilar\n(but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above.\nFor example,\nTask A3\ncan be written in these ways - all are equivalent.\nThe file\n/data/dates.txt\ncontains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to\n/data/dates-wednesdays.txt\nWrite the # of Thursdays in\n/data/extracts.txt\ninto\n/data/extracts-count.txt\n/data/contents.log\nमें कितने रविवार हैं? गिनो और /data/contents.dates में लिखो\n/data/contents.log\nல எத்தனை ஞாயிறு இருக்குனு கணக்கு போட்டு, அதை\n/data/contents.dates\nல எழுது\nYour task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps.\nPhase B: Handle Business Tasks\nThe DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that:\nB1\n. Data outside\n/data\nis never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it\nB2\n. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it\nThe DataWorks business team has listed\nbroad\nadditional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this:\nB3\n. Fetch data from an API and save it\nB4\n. Clone a git repo and make a commit\nB5\n. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database\nB6\n. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website\nB7\n. Compress or resize an image\nB8\n. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file\nB9\n. Convert Markdown to HTML\nB10\n. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data\nYour agent must handle these tasks as well.\nThe business team has\nnot\npromised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised a\nbonus\nif you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list.\nDeliverables\nCreate a new\npublic\nGitHub repository\nAdd an MIT\nLICENSE\nfile\nWrite and test your code. Call\nPOST /run?task=...\nwith a few tasks and check if\nGET /read?path=...\ncreates the correct files.\nCommit and push your code\nCreate a\nDockerfile\nthat builds your application\nPublish your Docker image\npublicly\nto\nDocker Hub\nEnsure that running your image via\npodman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME\nautomatically serves the API at\nhttp://localhost:8000/run?task=...\nand\nhttp://localhost:8000/read?path=...\nSubmit in this Google Form\nthe URL of your GitHub repository (\nhttps://github.com/user-name/repo-name\n) and your Docker image name (\nuser-name/repo-name\n)\nNote:\nUse the\nAIPROXY_TOKEN\nenvironment variable\n. DON’T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the\nAIPROXY_TOKEN\nenvironment variable before running your script. Use\nos.environ[\"AIPROXY_TOKEN\"]\nas the token in your script.\nUse your AI Proxy token\n. Your\nAI Proxy token\nnow has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. (But try and avoid that.)\nStick to GPT-4o-Mini\n. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says “LLM”, it means GPT-4o-Mini.\nKeep your prompts short and concise\n. Each call to\n/run\nand\n/read\nmust complete within 20 seconds.\nEvaluation\nThis\nevaluation script\nevaluates the scripts.Here’s how will evaluate a task, e.g.\nTask A2\n.\nCall\nPOST http://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2\n. Ensure that the respose is a HTTP 200.\nNote: The task may be worded differently. It may use a different prettier version. But the broad task is the same.\nCall\nGET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md\nand get the revised file contents.\nVerify that the response was formatted using\nprettier@3.4.2\n.\nHere’s how we will score the results.\nPre-requisites\n: Your repository\nMUST\nmeet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation\nYour GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\nYour GitHub repository has a\nLICENSE\nfile with the MIT license\nYour GitHub repository has a valid\nDockerfile\nYour Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via\npodman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME\nYour Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository\nPhase A: 10 marks\n. 1 mark for each Phase A task that the agent handles correctly.\nWe will run an evaluation script that will call\nhttps://localhost:8000/run?task=...\non the task and call\nhttps://localhost:8000/read?path=...\nto verify the output\nPhase B: 10 marks\n. 1 mark for each Phase B task that the agent handles correctly.\nThe evaluation script will call\nhttps://localhost:8000/run?task=...\non the task and call\nhttps://localhost:8000/read?path=...\nto verify the output\nBonus: Additional tasks\n. We\nmay\npass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.\nBonus: Code diversity\n. You’re encouraged to copy code and learn from each other. We encourage diversity too. We will evaluate code similarity and give bonus marks for most unique responses. (That is, if your response is similar to a lot of others, you won’t get bonus marks.)\nYour score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization, i.e. whether it’s 0/20 or 22/20, what you get is what you get.\nThis execution will be automated via:\nvalidate.py\nto check the pre-requisites and generate the eligible\nimages.txt\nexport AIPROXY_TOKEN=...\nto set the AI Proxy token\nrun.sh\nto evaluate all submissions."

You have just enrolled in the\nTools in Data Science\ncourse.\nTo make your life easier, you have decided to build an LLM-based application that can automatically answer any of the graded assignment questions.\nSpecifically, you are building and deploying an API that accepts any question from one of these 5 graded assignments:\nGraded Assignment 1\nGraded Assignment 2\nGraded Assignment 3\nGraded Assignment 4\nGraded Assignment 5\n… and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.\nCreate an API\nYour application exposes an API endpoint. Let’s assume that it is at\nhttps://your-app.vercel.app/api/\n.\nThe endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g.\nPOST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\nwith the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data.\nFor example, here’s how anyone can make a request:\ncurl\n-X\nPOST\n\"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\"\n\\\n-H\n\"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\"\n\\\n-F\n\"question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the \"\nanswer\n\" column of the CSV file?\"\n\\\n-F\n\"file=@abcd.zip\"\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nThe response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field:\nanswer\nthat can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:\n{\n\"answer\"\n:\n\"1234567890\"\n}\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nDeploy your application\nDeploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone.

Explore:\nAnthropic Prompt Optimizer\nOpenAI Prompt Generation\nGoogle AI-powered prompt writing tools\nBe clear, direct, and detailed\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\nBAD\n:\nExplain gravitation lensing.\n(Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\nGOOD\n:\nExplain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n(Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\nWhen you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\nThe clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get.\nFor example, don’t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\nSay, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nGive examples\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\nBAD\n:\nExplain how to tie a bow tie.\n(Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\nGOOD\n:\nExplain how to tie a bow tie. For example:\nTo tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight…\nTo tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through…\nNow, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie.\n(Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\nGive examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’\nGiving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nThink step by step\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\nBAD\n:\nGiven this transcript, is the customer satisfied?\n(Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\nGOOD\n:\nGiven this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step.\n(Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\nAsk the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\nThat’s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\nInstead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\nFor example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nAssign a role\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\nBAD\n:\nExplain how to fix a software bug.\n(Reason: No role or perspective given.)\nGOOD\n:\nYou are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process.\n(Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\nTell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.\nBy clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style.\nSuddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nUse XML to structure your prompt\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\nBAD\n:\nHere’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example.\n(Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\nGOOD\n:\n<\ninstructions\n>\nProvide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n</\ninstructions\n>\n<\nexample\n>\nThen provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n</\nexample\n>\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n(Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\nThink of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box.\nThey help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nUse Markdown to format your output\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\nBAD\n:\nGive me the steps in plain text.\n(Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\nGOOD\n:\nProvide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points.\n(Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\nBAD\n:\nCorrect the spelling and show the corrections.\n(Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\nGOOD\n:\nCorrect the spelling, showing <ins>additions</ins> and <del>deletions</del>.\n(Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\nMarkdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.\nYou can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points.\nThese make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\nUse JSON for machine-readable output\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\nBAD\n:\nJust list the items.\n(Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\nGOOD\n:\nOrganize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n```\njson\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Item 1\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Description of Item 1\"\n}\n,\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Item 2\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Description of Item 2\"\n}\n,\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Item 3\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Description of Item 3\"\n}\n]\n```\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n(Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\nNote: Always use\nJSON schema\nif possible.\nJSON schema\nis a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\nImagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later.\nJSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes.\nEverything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines.\nFor example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object.\nThat way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use.\nPrefer Yes/No answers\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\nBAD\n:\nOn a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?\n(Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\nGOOD\n:\nIs this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No.\n(Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.)\nDon’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five…’. Models are not good with numbers.\nThey don’t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick.\nSo, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\nAsk for reason first, then the answer\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps\nbefore\nstating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\nBAD\n:\nWhat is the best route to take?\n(Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\nGOOD\n:\nFirst, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route.\n(Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\nBEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\nThat way, the model won’t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\nUse proper spelling and grammar\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\nBAD\n:\nxplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??\n(Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\nGOOD\n:\nExplain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation.\n(Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\nIf your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly.\nWhen you do, the response will be much clearer.\nVideo Tutorials\nWatch\nPrompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min)\n. It covers:\nBasics of\nAI and large language models\n.\nHow to write clear and detailed prompts to improve answers.\nTips for creating interactive and personalized AI responses.\nAdvanced topics like\nAI mistakes\n(hallucinations) and\ntext embeddings\n(how AI understands words).\nFun examples, like making AI write poems or correct grammar."

Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky.\nLearn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language.\nSome programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly.\nLearn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.\nUnicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:\nCharacter Encodings\n: Different ways to represent text in computers\nASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only\nUTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII\nUTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java\nUTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple\nCommon encoding issues you’ll encounter:\n# Reading files with explicit encoding\nwith\nopen\n(\n'file.txt'\n,\nencoding\n=\n'utf-8'\n)\nas\nf\n:\ntext\n=\nf\n.\nread\n(\n)\n# Handling encoding errors\nimport\npandas\nas\npd\ndf\n=\npd\n.\nread_csv\n(\n'data.csv'\n,\nencoding\n=\n'utf-8'\n,\nerrors\n=\n'replace'\n)\n# Detecting file encoding\nimport\nchardet\nwith\nopen\n(\n'unknown.txt'\n,\n'rb'\n)\nas\nf\n:\nresult\n=\nchardet\n.\ndetect\n(\nf\n.\nread\n(\n)\n)\nprint\n(\nresult\n[\n'encoding'\n]\n)\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied"

(This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you\nDON’T\nneed a vector database. You can can use\nnumpy\nfor these tasks.)\nVector databases are an evolving space.\nThe first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called\nHNSW\n(a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:\nchroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025\nqdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025\nlancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025\nfaiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025\nmilvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025\nweaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025\nIn addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:\nDuckDB\n: Supports vector search with\nvss\n.\nSQLite\n: Supports vector search with\nsqlite-vec\n.\nPostgreSQL\n: Supports vector search with\npgvector\n.\nTake a look at this\nVector

They’re perfect for small web tools that\ndon’t need to run all the time\n. Here are some common real-life uses:\nA contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\nA tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\nA chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\nA newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\nA webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\nYou can’t\npip install\npackages - you have to use\nrequirements.txt\nYou can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\nYou can’t run commands (e.g.\nsubprocess.run()\n)\nVercel\nis a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\nHere’s a\nquickstart\n.\nSign-up with Vercel\n. Create an empty\ngit\nrepo with this\napi/index.py\nfile.\nTo deploy a FastAPI app, add a\nrequirements.txt\nfile with\nfastapi\nas a dependency.\nfastapi\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nAdd your FastAPI code to a file, e.g.\nmain.py\n.\n# main.py\nfrom\nfastapi\nimport\nFastAPI\n\napp\n=\nFastAPI\n(\n)\n@app\n.\nget\n(\n\"/\"\n)\ndef\nread_root\n(\n)\n:\nreturn\n{\n\"message\"\n:\n\"Hello, World!\"\n}\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nAdd a\nvercel.json\nfile to the root of your repository.\n{\n\"builds\"\n:\n[\n{\n\"src\"\n:\n\"main.py\"\n,\n\"use\"\n:\n\"@vercel/python\"\n}\n]\n,\n\"routes\"\n:\n[\n{\n\"src\"\n:\n\"/(.*)\"\n,\n\"dest\"\n:\n\"main.py\"\n}\n]\n}\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nOn the command line, run:\nnpx vercel\nto deploy a test version\nnpx vercel --prod\nto deploy to production\nEnvironment Variables\n. Use\nnpx vercel env add\nto add environment variables. In your code, use\nos.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')\nto access them.\nVideos"

From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\nBut one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\nYou learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you’ll have to scrape them yourself.\nYou learn how to train models. But soon, you’ll just pick something from HuggingFace.\nYou learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a\nsed\n+\ngrep\nscript in minutes.\n“We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You’ll have to decode the regexes yourself.”\nIn this course, we’ve curated the most important tools people use in data science.\nLearn them well. You’ll be a\nlot\nmore productive\nthan your peers.\nThis course is quite hard\nHere’s students’ feedback:\nIt\nused\nto be an easy course until 2024.\n#\n#\n#\nNow it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n#\n#\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n#\n#\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably.\n#\n#\nThe ROE is hard.\n#\nTake Graded assignment 1\nto check if you’re ready for this course.\nPlease drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\nProgramming skills are a pre-requisite\nYou need a\ngood\nunderstanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\nBut isn’t this a data science course?\nYes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are,\nsome\nof the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you\ndo\nneed programming to learn many of them.\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou\nCAN\ncopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach\nwhat you’ve learnt.\nWe cover 7 modules in 12 weeks\nThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the\ncommit history\nfor changes.\nReleased content:\nDevelopment Tools\nand concepts to\nbuild\nmodels and apps.\nDiscussion Thread\nDeployment Tools\nand concepts to\npublish\nwhat you built.\nDiscussion Thread\nLarge Language Models\nthat make your work easier and your apps smarter.\nDiscussion Thread\nData Sourcing\nto get data from the web, files, and databases.\nDiscussion Thread\nData Preparation\nto clean up and convert the inputs to the right format.\nDiscussion Thread\nProject 1\nto build an LLM-based automation agent.\nDiscussion Thread\nWork in progress:\nData Analysis\nto find surprising insights in the data.\nData Visualization\nto communicate those insights as visual stories.\nEvaluations are mostly open Internet\nExam\nType\nWeight\nRelease Date\nSubmission Date\nGA: Graded assignments\nBest 4 out of 7 ‡\n15%\nGraded Assignment 1\nOnline open MCQ\n30 Dec 2024\n26 Jan 2025\nGraded Assignment 2\nOnline open MCQ\n3 Jan 2025\n2 Feb 2025\nGraded Assignment 3\nOnline open MCQ\n15 Jan 2025\n5 Feb 2025\nGraded Assignment 4\nOnline open MCQ\n31 Jan 2025\n9 Feb 2025\nP1: Project 1\nTake-home open-Internet\n20%\n19 Jan 2025\n16 Feb 2025\nGraded Assignment 5\nOnline open MCQ\n7 Feb 2025\n21 Feb 2025\nGraded Assignment 6\nOnline open MCQ\n28 Feb 2025\n16 Mar 2025\nP2: Project 2\nTake-home open-Internet\n20%\n3 Mar 2025\n31 Mar 2025\nGraded Assignment 7\nOnline open MCQ\n14 Mar 2025\n26 Mar 2025\nROE: Remote Online Exam\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\n20%\n02 Mar 2025 13:00\n02 Mar 2025 13:45\nF: Final end-term\nIn-person, no internet, mandatory\n25%\n13 Apr 2025\nUpdates\n13 Jan 2025: GA3 release date moved from 10 Jan 2025 to 15 Jan 2025 due to faculty delay.

From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\nBut one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\nYou learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you’ll have to scrape them yourself.\nYou learn how to train models. But soon, you’ll just pick something from HuggingFace.\nYou learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a\nsed\n+\ngrep\nscript in minutes.\n“We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics.

It’ll be too tough for you now.\nProgramming skills are a pre-requisite\nYou need a\ngood\nunderstanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\nBut isn’t this a data science course?\nYes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are,\nsome\nof the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you\ndo\nneed programming to learn many of them.\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou\nCAN\ncopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach\nwhat you’ve learnt.\nWe cover 7 modules in 12 weeks\nThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the\ncommit history\nfor changes.\nReleased content:\nDevelopment Tools\nand concepts to\nbuild\nmodels and apps.\nDiscussion Thread\nDeployment Tools\nand concepts to\npublish\nwhat you built.\nDiscussion Thread\nLarge Language Models\nthat make your work easier and your apps smarter.\nDiscussion Thread\nData Sourcing\nto get data from the web, files, and databases.\nDiscussion Thread\nData Preparation\nto clean up and convert the inputs to the right format.\nDiscussion Thread\nProject 1\nto build an LLM-based automation agent.\nDiscussion Thread\nWork in progress:\nData Analysis\nto find surprising insights in the data.\nData Visualization\nto communicate those insights as visual stories.\nEvaluations are mostly open Internet\nExam\nType\nWeight\nRelease Date\nSubmission Date\nGA: Graded assignments\nBest 4 out of 7 ‡\n15%\nGraded Assignment 1\nOnline open MCQ\n30 Dec 2024\n26 Jan 2025\nGraded Assignment 2\nOnline open MCQ\n3 Jan 2025\n2 Feb 2025\nGraded Assignment 3\nOnline open MCQ\n15 Jan 2025\n5 Feb 2025\nGraded Assignment 4\nOnline open MCQ\n31 Jan 2025\n9 Feb 2025\nP1: Project 1\nTake-home open-Internet\n20%\n19 Jan 2025\n16 Feb 2025\nGraded Assignment 5\nOnline open MCQ\n7 Feb 2025\n21 Feb 2025\nGraded Assignment 6\nOnline open MCQ\n28 Feb 2025\n16 Mar 2025\nP2: Project 2\nTake-home open-Internet\n20%\n3 Mar 2025\n31 Mar 2025\nGraded Assignment 7\nOnline open MCQ\n14 Mar 2025\n26 Mar 2025\nROE: Remote Online Exam\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\n20%\n02 Mar 2025 13:00\n02 Mar 2025 13:45\nF: Final end-term\nIn-person, no internet, mandatory\n25%\n13 Apr 2025\nUpdates\n13 Jan 2025: GA3 release date moved from 10 Jan 2025 to 15 Jan 2025 due to faculty delay.

From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\nBut one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\nYou learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you’ll have to scrape them yourself.\nYou learn how to train models.

Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are,\nsome\nof the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive.

Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you’re copying.

From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\nBut one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\nThese tools might not help your CV much.

Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.).
